If you are considering applying to university to study biology, zoology, ecology, animal science, marine biology, life sciences, medicine, environmental science, forensic science or any other subject related to the natural world, then A-level biology is essential, with many other courses preferring biology at either AS or A-level.","EntryRequirements":"Students should be aged 16 to 18 years old. You will need grade 5 in GCSE Biology or 55 in Combined Science plus grade 5 in GCSE Maths and grade 4 in English Language.","WhatYoullLearn":"In your first year, you will study a wide variety of units from cells and mammalian transport and digestion, through to genetics and health and disease. In your second year, you will study more detailed aspects of Biology such as\r\nthe nervous system, muscles and homeostasis, evolution and genetic engineering. Their applications in modern scientific research are emphasised.","HowYoullLearn":"Learning for this course will be a mixture of methods,  practical work in one of the laboratories and classroom based exercises.","WhatYoullNeed":"Pen, Note Pad","HowYoullBeAssessed":"Biology is a Linear A Level so assessment will take place at the end of the two year course.

This is not examined but forms the practical endorsement on your exam certificate.","WhereNext":"There are many careers for which Biology is either essential or very useful - zoology, medicine, nursing, dentistry, physiotherapy, forensics, criminology, veterinary science, pharmacy, pharmacology, biochemistry, sports therapy,\r\npsychology, speech therapy, forestry, biotechnology, food science, microbiology, radiography, teaching, business, science writing or art.","AdultEducationBudget":false,"AdvancedLearnerLoan":false,"CourseRuns":[{"id":"c20f6b1b-bb8a-4243-8021-4f57c2d7f620","CourseInstanceId":7123284,"VenueId":"efd9b53d-8d1c-4944-ad6a-6ca59a7d0ada","CourseName":"A-Level Biology","ProviderCourseID":"AL-BIOLO","DeliveryMode":1,"FlexibleStartDate":false,"StartDate":"2020-09-01T00:00:00","CourseURL":"https://www.carmel.ac.uk/school-leaver-courses-16-18/a-level-subjects/biology/","Cost":null,"CostDescription":"Free to 16 - 18 year olds","DurationUnit":4,"DurationValue":2,"StudyMode":1,"AttendancePattern":1,"National":null,"Regions":null,"RecordStatus":1,"CreatedDate":"2019-07-03T14:25:45.4579097+00:00","CreatedBy":"DFC – Course Migration Tool","UpdatedDate":"2019-10-09T12:36:24.792654+00:00","UpdatedBy":"kateb@carmel.ac.uk","SubRegions":null,"BulkUploadErrors":null}],"CourseStatus":1,"CreatedDate":"2019-07-03T14:25:45.4579168+00:00","CreatedBy":"DFC – Course Migration Tool","UpdatedDate":"2019-10-17T12:01:59.3559787+00:00","IsValid":true,"UpdatedBy":"kateb@carmel.ac.uk","BulkUploadErrors":null,"LarlessReason":null},{"id":"27cf49b3-5b20-4f7f-ac73-2f4b9e4c3898","CourseId":55086603,"QualificationCourseTitle":"GCE A Level in English Literature","LearnAimRef":"60148706","NotionalNVQLevelv2":"3","AwardOrgCode":"WJEC","QualificationType":"GCE A level","ProviderUKPRN":10001201,"CourseDescription":"A-Level English Literature is a great subject for students who enjoy reading, thinking independently and evaluating ideas. This is a two year linear course where you will gain a better understanding of interpretations within literary texts through methods of analysis, expressing this in cogent, detailed and critical essays. \r\nFor the exams, you will read and compare a variety of literature, from classic plays to modern poetry, evaluating interpretations from your close reading of texts such as The Tempest, The Duchess of Malfi and The Whitsun Weddings in addition to analysing unseen prose and poetry in the exam. The coursework, which is worth 20%, is a 2500-3500 word comparative essay and allows you to pick a novel of your choice from your own wider reading at A Level.","EntryRequirements":"Students should be aged 16 to 18 years old.

There's often no right or wrong answer when it comes to Macroeconomics, so you need to be able to present arguments clearly, supported by relevant examples.\r\nYou can't rely entirely on your textbook. Economics is the life-blood of political debate, and you need to keep up to date, following news online and in print  to pick up on economic, political, business and social issues.","EntryRequirements":"Students should be aged 16 to 18 years old.

Economics is a study of scarce resources and how those resources are allocated to various uses in an economy. \r\nThe subject is split into three broad areas of study:\r\nMicroeconomics: this unit looks at the supply and demand of both goods and labour. Have you ever wondered why Gareth Bale earns in just seven days what many of his fans will earn in an entire decade?\r\nThis unit also looks at costs, revenues and profits in a variety of different markets. Why do Businesses pay $4.4 million for a 30 second advertising slot in the Super Bowl?\r\nMacroeconomics: this unit looks macroeconomic issues, such as inflation, unemployment, exports and imports. Do you want to know how much influence the financial sector has on the UK economy? What is the role of the Bank of England? Should the NHS be privatised? Is the HS2 a waste of resources? How much does the country owe and who do we owe the money to?\r\nTrade and Development: this unit looks at why countries trade and the importance of Globalisation. What impact will Brexit have on the UK economy? What are the problems facing emerging economies? Why do companies like Apple and Nike set up factories in China?","HowYoullLearn":"Learning for this course will be classroom based exercises.","WhatYoullNeed":"Pen, Note Pad","HowYoullBeAssessed":"The subject content for A level Economics will be assessed across three examination papers.\r\nComponent 1: Economic Principles\r\nWritten examination: 1 hour 30 minutes\r\n30% of qualification\r\nComponent 2: Exploring Economic Behaviour\r\nWritten examination: 2 hours 30 minutes\r\n30% of qualification\r\nComponent 3: Evaluating Economic Models and Policies\r\nWritten examination: 2 hours 30 minutes\r\n40% of qualification","WhereNext":"A high proportion of A Level students decide to continue their study of the subject at a higher level.\r\nDegree courses in Economics and related disciplines (such as Money, Banking and Finance, Business Studies, Sociology, Management Studies, Economic History, Politics) are increasingly popular at a variety of Higher Education institutions.

There are strict rules as to how evidence is collected from a crime scene\r\nand also strict rules governing the giving of evidence in court. \r\n\r\nUnit 4: Crime scene and punishment - Most people in our society are law-abiding and unwilling to break laws. Law-breaking\r\nis frequently of the petty variety, so serious crime and repeat offending is often restricted to a few people who\r\ncannot or will not abide by the rules that most of us consider to be so important.

The course is chiefly for a student who wishes to study Mathematics, Engineering or any related subject in Higher Education.\r\n\r\nWhy study AS Further Maths?\r\nFurther Mathematics is designed for students with an enthusiasm for Mathematics, many of whom will go on to degrees in Mathematics, Engineering, the Sciences and Economics. Students who study this course go off to University and find the content covered and skills acquired of great benefit. If you are considering a Mathematics or Engineering based degree you may find that some Universities will actually require that you have studied Further Mathematics.

The aim is to provide students (normally 19+) with the knowledge, skills and attitudes needed for success at university.  Our Access courses focus on areas of social science, social work and health care, with students going on to study for degrees in subjects such as: Nursing, Midwifery, Psychology, Sociology, Criminology, Social Work, Sports Science and various health care specialisms.\r\n\r\nAccess students come from a broad age range and varied backgrounds, and are typically dedicated and hard-working, having made a conscious decision to return to education.  They have the advantage of life experience and sometimes employment to draw upon, and are generally very well received by Higher Education institutions.\r\n\r\nThere are three important documents here for students interested in finding out more about Access course opportunities at Portsmouth College.  The Course Information Sheet provides details on the courses available, entry requirements, sources of information on university and careers and the application/interview process.  Please read the information here carefully as we hope it will answer many of your questions.\r\n\r\nFrequently Asked Questions will help you with your research before and after you make an application.
